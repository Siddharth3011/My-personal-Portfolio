            <div class="my-1">I am Siddharth Pandey, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and
                Engineering from ABES Institute of Technology, Ghaziabad. I completed my 12th in 2022 and am on track to
                graduate in 2027.
                <br><br>
                I have a strong foundation in programming and web development, with skills in HTML, CSS, Python, and C
                programming. I am enthusiastic about leveraging my knowledge to solve real-world problems and am always
                eager to explore new technologies and tools.
                <br><br>
                As a passionate learner, I look forward to opportunities that allow me to grow, collaborate, and
                contribute meaningfully to projects. Whether itâ€™s building efficient code or creating seamless user
                experiences, I am excited to make an impact in the tech industry.
